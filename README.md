<p>Here are the things you need to know if you want to succeed this assignment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One or more philosophers sit at a round table. 
  There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.</li>
  <li>The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep. 
  While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping; while thinking, 
  they are not eating nor sleeping; and, of course, while sleeping, 
  they are not eating nor thinking.</li>
  <li>There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks 
  as philosophers.</li>
  <li>Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one fork is 
  very inconvenient, a philosopher takes their right and their 
  left forks to eat, one in each hand.</li>
  <li>When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks 
  back on the table and start sleeping. Once awake, they start 
  thinking again. The simulation stops when a philosopher dies 
  of starvation.</li>
  <li>Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.</li>
  <li>Philosophers don’t speak with each other.</li>
  <li>Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.</li>
  <li>No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!</li>
</ul>
