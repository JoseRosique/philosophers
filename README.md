    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Here are the things you need to know if you want to succeed this assignment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One or more philosophers sit at a round table.</li>
      <li>There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.</li>
      <li>The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep.
        <ul>
          <li>While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;</li>
          <li>while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;</li>
          <li>and, of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers.</li>
      <li>Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one fork is very inconvenient, a philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand.</li>
      <li>When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation.</li>
      <li>Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.</li>
      <li>Philosophers don’t speak with each other.</li>
      <li>Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.</li>
      <li>No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!</li>
    </ul>
